# butterfly_cnn
This is a practice/example implementation of MobileNet v3 Small trained with
ImageNet but configured to classify butterfly species native to Florida.

This code is intended to serve as a blueprint to follow for the final implementation.

Note: I am running the 3.13.1 version of Python

Goals:
- Incorporate the prototypical model of FewShot learning when retraining the model
- Incorporate the preprocessing/data augmentation of the collected images from the sensors
- Run the model on Raspberry Pi 4 in real time
